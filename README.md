# FlightMobileServer
## OverView
In this project we created an ןntermediary server that mediates between an anroid app and a flight simulator.  
The app sends a commend, and the server passes the command to the simulator.  
In the same way, the server reads information from the simulator and passes it to the app.  

## How to use  
1. Place the files in a zip folder called "FlightMobile".  
2. Locate the dummy_server and build_and_run files and the screenshot_server zip folder in the same location as the zip folder above.  
3. Double click the dummy_server, and the unzip the screenshot_server, and double click screenshot_server/app file.  
4. Double click the build_and_run file.
